# RPG-Multiplayer-Game
This is an RPG game that I created, It is like a basic RPG game. It is set in an medieval era village and follows a
simple quest of finding your brother who hasn't come home. You can interact with different NPCs in the game to extract
info about your brother and find clues to look for your brother in the game.
This game also features Multiplayer in it, which I created using the Photon Unity Networking. In the Multiplayer game
you simply either Create a Room or Join a Room in the Lobby by entering the name of the Room and then you will be
logged in the multiplayer game where you can play the game with your friends. The Multiplayer features some simple basic 
controls for now and new features will be added to game in future.
 
 The Characters used are from "Mixamo.com" and the prefabs used for houses, trees and as such are from "cgtrader.com".
 
 The Gameplay Images are provided in the GamePlay Images & Video folder and the Gameplay video is -"https://youtu.be/_jVrJQjr9oQ".
